Method parameters
===================================

* Plot
    Which plot to draw decision, force or both

* Background data
    What background data will be used to sample from, when simulating "missing" feature

    * KMeans: use KMeans to sample from provided dataset
    * Custom variable: provide variable (that is in :code:`kernel_globals`) with instances to use

* Count of KMeans centers
    Number of means to use when creating background data. Only used if :code:`Background data` is set to :code:`KMeans`

* Background data variable
    Variable with background data from which the "missing" features will be sampled. Only used if :code:`Background data` is set to :code:`Custom variable`

* Link
    A generalized linear model link to connect the feature importance values to the model output

    Since the feature importance values, phi, sum up to the model output, it often makes sense
    to connect them to the ouput with a link function where link(outout) = sum(phi).

    If the model output is a probability then the LogitLink link function makes the feature importance values have log-odds units.
